## Lassie

Lassie is a simple watchdog service written in CoffeeScript. It sports a
basic modular architecture that can host multiple types of service checks
and alerts.

Lassie doesn't do any graphing or statistical collection. You probably
want statsd+Graphite or Munin if you're looking for something like that.
Lassie will notify you if a service goes down (and comes back up), nothing
more.


### Checks and Alerts

A few standard checks and alerts are included with Lassie. If you know
Javascript or CoffeeScript, then it is easy to create your own checks and
alerts.

#### Checks

- **ping**: Basic ICMP echo request. A cheap and not-foolproof way of
  checking if a server is alive on a network. Note that a server can
  respond to pings but still be "down" in some sense, so this rarely a
  sufficient check by itself.
- **web**: Retrieve a remote URL and look in the resulting payload for a
  specific fragment string. Can be useful to assess whether the payload is
  the expected body or whether it's an error message.
- **tcp**: Similar to the **web** check, but uses a raw TCP connection.
- **rest**: Retrieve a RESTful API endpoint and check if the HTTP status
  code was 200. If not, then it will be considered to be in a fail state.


#### Alerts

- **email**: 'nuff said.
- **sms**: Uses Twilio, so you will need an account with them.
- **slack**: You'll need to create a Bot Integration within your Slack
  account and use the provided API token.
- **pushover**: A SaaS product that sends push alerts to your phone. See
  their [website](https://pushover.net) for more details.
